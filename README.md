# NBA_STATS
 
The goal of this project is to pull stats from the NBA in real time with the ability to compare players against highly specific coonstraints. Although still in progress the next step is to predict the outcomes of highly specific stats of players and teams with the usage of injury reports and other extraneous variables.
